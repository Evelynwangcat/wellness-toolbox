            However, connecting with and/or helping others boosts the neurotransmitter oxytocin which will boost our wellbeing. So plan to connect with other people every day, particularly with close friends and/or family, but also with the local community.<br>
            It may just be smiling and saying hello to strangers in the street or at the corner shop.<br>
            You might consider helping out with a voluntary organisation, or find a local support group. You can find out what is available locally from the internet, or at your local library or citizen's advice bureau.<br>
            It's important to connect face to face, but as a first step, or additionally, we can connect to others via the internet.

We tend to keep doing those things that drain and deplete us, but neglect those that we enjoy and which energise and nourish us.<br>

            Read more about nourishing vs depleting activities here (www.m.get.gg/energisingdraining.htm)<br>
            Aim to do more enjoyable activities. Maybe something you used to enjoy doing (e.g. hobby or sport), or something you've thought you would like to do. It might be something outdoors, or with other people, or maybe just on your own at home.<br>
            Add more colour into your life!

            It seems like doing those things help at the time, but by reacting the same way all the time, we just keep the problem going. (About CBT - www.m.get.gg/cbt.htm). We can learn to react and think differently!</span>
